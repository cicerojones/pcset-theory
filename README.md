pcset-theory
============

These files contain Lisp code that works with the pitch-class sets of
post-tonal music theory. Specifically, imset-code-only-functions
provides a "imset-decision-maker," which is roughly described in
various pieces of documentation throughout the files.

The overall project is in rough form, but is in the process of being
refactored into more logical pieces and documented more
conventionally.
